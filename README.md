#TYFONE
Hardware files for the tyfone. Hopefully the final product looks as good as the SolidWorks files. 

###Files

2. Hardware/typhone-bottom.sldprt is the bottom part to be 3D printed.
3. Hardware/typhone-top.sldprt is the top part and is another part to be 3D printed.

The other .sldprt files are electronic boards for inside the typhone. Everything made in SolidWorks
